00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:07.275
I would say Udacity definitely played a big part in helping me transform my career.

00:00:07.275 --> 00:00:09.705
Before I was in Retail Banking.

00:00:09.705 --> 00:00:14.160
The moment I realized that,why within a moment

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.570
do I feel excited to go there or is it just something that,

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.010
"Hey, I got a job.

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.755
I should just be grateful for the fact that I got a job".

00:00:22.754 --> 00:00:26.789
I've been always drawn to creating things.

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.289
So I studied Multimedia Computer Science and then I joined Mercedes,

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.265
became a Service Manager for IT and in recent years,

00:00:35.265 --> 00:00:38.625
there was some cultural change in my company.

00:00:38.625 --> 00:00:42.134
So there was a Big Data team created.

00:00:42.134 --> 00:00:47.629
Data is everywhere, and more and more companies are hiring key people,

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.935
who can analyze and visualize data to make key decision.

00:00:51.935 --> 00:00:56.210
Introducing Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree Program.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.210
In this program, you will master the skills you

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.274
need to establish a successful career as a data analyst.

00:01:03.274 --> 00:01:07.219
Our curriculum was developed with leading industry partners,

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:10.939
to ensure students gain the most valuable data analytical skills.

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:14.314
While I was in the Nanodegree, I learned a lot.

00:01:14.314 --> 00:01:18.634
I think it's more of how to look at data in a different way.

00:01:18.635 --> 00:01:20.180
The projects I'm doing,

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.265
they're actually more helpful.

00:01:22.265 --> 00:01:28.329
I know the skills that I acquired can actually help me with getting employed.

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:33.590
So what changed in my professional life was that I was able to

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:40.549
convincingly show people that this is something I am now a specialist in.

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:45.245
Now I'm becoming Architect for Data Science at Mercedes.

00:01:45.245 --> 00:01:49.564
Well, when I got that job offer and that was the best feeling ever.

00:01:49.564 --> 00:01:54.060
At least [inaudible]. Yeah, I mean I haven't.
