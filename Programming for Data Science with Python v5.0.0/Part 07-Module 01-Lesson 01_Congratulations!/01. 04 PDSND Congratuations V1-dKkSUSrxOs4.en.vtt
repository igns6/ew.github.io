00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
Congratulations on finishing the programming for data science Nanodegree program.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.669
You now have a strong foundation in Python programming,

00:00:08.669 --> 00:00:13.905
SQL, and are familiar with foundation concepts like Shell and Git.

00:00:13.904 --> 00:00:17.234
None of these are small accomplishments in themselves.

00:00:17.234 --> 00:00:22.379
Taken together, you have demonstrated not just that you can learn difficult concepts,

00:00:22.379 --> 00:00:25.399
but that you have the grid persistent and

00:00:25.399 --> 00:00:28.759
ability to overcome frustrating moments in programming.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.550
You should feel really proud of yourself.

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.130
Take the time to celebrate this accomplishment.

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:39.245
You're now well positioned for a next sequence of courses in data science.

00:00:39.244 --> 00:00:43.719
The data analysts Nanodegree and data scientists Nanodegree.
