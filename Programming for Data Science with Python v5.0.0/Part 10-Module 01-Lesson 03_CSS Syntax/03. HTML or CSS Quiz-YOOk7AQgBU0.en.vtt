00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.940
Moving from left to right,
let's look at the first choice.

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:09.020
The first choice has an image and
a numbered list followed by some text.

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:14.140
While it might seem like this page is
using additional CSS, in fact, it isn't.

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.630
The image, numbered list and
text are simply content on the page and

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.310
look like this with just HTML.

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.300
The spacing you see between the elements
is just the default styling applied by

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.370
the Google Chrome browser.

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:29.400
As you start writing CSS moving forward,

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.900
it is important to remember that
each browser comes with its own set

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.250
of default styling that
might be slightly unique.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:37.890
Next, looking at number two,

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.902
you see some different sized
headings as well as a hyperlink.

00:00:41.902 --> 00:00:44.410
The hyperlink is blue and
underlined, but

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.900
this is not because additional
CSS is being applied.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:53.200
Again, by default Google Chrome is
applying some default styling to HTML.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.490
In this case, Chrome's default styling
is to change links to be blue and

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:58.050
underlined.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.980
Finally, this leaves
us with option three.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.060
If you look at option three,

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.470
you can see that there is a colored
button, as well as images and

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.240
text that have been aligned
horizontally to the center of the page.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.900
You might also notice
the use of a different font.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.710
To style a page like this
requires the use of CSS.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.150
So, option three is the correct answer.
