00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.690
Check out this CSS code
from Coca Cola's website.

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:04.612
Looks intense.

00:00:04.612 --> 00:00:09.130
Before you'll be able to write CSS
code like this, you first need to

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.790
understand the basic building blocks
that make up a single CSS statement.

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.070
All CSS begins with what
is known as a rule set.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.000
A rule set is made up of two parts,
a selector, which is the code that

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.610
selects the HTML elements that you want
to style, and a declaration block,

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:31.590
which is the code that describes the
styles you want to apply to said HTML.

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.639
Declarations are the lines of code
written inside the curly braces.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.040
As an example, let's look at
this simple unstyled web page.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.570
On the left, I have my web page, and
on the right, I have my code for

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.840
the web page.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.820
Remember how the head of
the page is used used for

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.070
the meta-information about the site?

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.300
Style is one of the pieces of
information that goes inside the head.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.940
Anything that goes inside
these style tags is CSS.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.480
For this example, I'll start by
typing p, followed by some braces,

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.740
then color: blue, and ending with a ;.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.420
This p is our selector.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.384
It is telling the browser,
I want to select all the p tags, or

00:01:15.384 --> 00:01:17.458
paragraph tags, on the page.

00:01:17.458 --> 00:01:20.515
The code inside the curly
braces is our declaration.

00:01:20.515 --> 00:01:27.190
It reads, color: blue;.

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.940
In this line color is the property
we want to change and

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.050
blue is the value we want to pass to it.

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.250
This is how CSS works for
every property.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.810
You pass it a value, like blue, and the
value describes how the browser should

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.930
render the property for the element.

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.790
Properties are always
written in plain English.

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.360
And they identify a feature of an HTML
element that you want to change.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.440
So let's see what this page
looks like after I add this CSS.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:01.260
I'll just Save, and let me go refresh
my page and voila, there you go.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.840
When I added the CSS to the web page,
the color of the font and

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.750
the paragraph tags changed to blue.
