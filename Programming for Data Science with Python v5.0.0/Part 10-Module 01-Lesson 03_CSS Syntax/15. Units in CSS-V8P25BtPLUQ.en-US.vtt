00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:03.410
To answer the question,
willing to add the correct CSS.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.050
Conveniently, the class selectors have
already been written out for us, so

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:10.770
we just need to add the right
properties and their values.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:13.970
I'll go ahead and add those,
and let's see what they do.

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:15.790
If I save and

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:21.120
refresh the page, you can see that our
divs now look a little bit different.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.530
The first div no longer extends
from end to end on the page.

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:27.910
But instead,
covers up this 100 pixel space.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.520
That's because we've changed
the width to be 100 pixels.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.580
Next, the second div looks
twice as tall as it used to be.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.890
This makes sense because we've doubled
its height from the a hundred pixels,

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.620
I set it to originally.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.330
Looking at the third div,
we now see one of space around the div.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.700
This comes from the use
of the property margin.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.110
We'll cover the property margin in
more detail later in this course, but

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.160
try experimenting with it to
see exactly what it does.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.840
And finally, the paragraph in
the fourth div is now using a font size

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.950
double its previous size.

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.250
That's because we've set
the font size to be 2em.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.860
If the font size was set to 1em,
then the font size of the paragraph

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.700
would be exactly the same size as
the paragraph in the third div.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.750
But by setting the font size to 2ems,

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.410
we are effectively doubling
its normal default size.
