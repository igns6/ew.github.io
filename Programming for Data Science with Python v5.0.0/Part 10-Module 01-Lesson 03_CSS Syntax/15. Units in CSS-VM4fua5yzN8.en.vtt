00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:01.880
Let's practice.

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:06.370
For this quiz, I want you to try using
some properties that require units.

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:08.640
I've created this web
page as a sandbox for

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.330
you to sample different CSS properties.

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:12.970
I've also added some styling, so

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:16.075
that you can see the different
elements on the page.

00:00:16.075 --> 00:00:19.495
Mostly this includes, setting the height
of the elements to a hundred pixels and

00:00:19.495 --> 00:00:21.735
giving them unique background colors.

00:00:21.735 --> 00:00:22.705
To complete this quiz,

00:00:22.705 --> 00:00:27.045
you will need to set the width
of the first div to 100 pixels.

00:00:27.045 --> 00:00:30.370
The height of the second
div to 200 pixels.

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:33.830
The margin of the third div to one M and

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.930
the font size of
the forth div to two Ms.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:37.430
Good luck.
