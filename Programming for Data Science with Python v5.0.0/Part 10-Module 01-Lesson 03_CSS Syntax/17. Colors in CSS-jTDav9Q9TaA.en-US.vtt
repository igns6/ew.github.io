00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.600
Looking at the first choice we actually
have the hexadecimal value for red.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.510
I know this because for the red channel
ff means we're using 100% of the red.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.610
But for the green and blue channels.

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:12.850
Both are 00.

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.110
Which means we're using 0% green and
blue light.

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:17.660
So this doesn't work.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.610
Next, we have the actual name
blue being passed as a value.

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:23.150
This one actually works.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.350
That's because CSS supports
a standard set of named color values.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:29.350

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.700
Personally my favorite
is blanched almond.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.200
And yes, that's actually a color.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.120
For the next one.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.820
We have an RGB value.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.660
This is saying we have 0 red,
0 green and 255 blue.

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.740
Or 100% blue.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.660
This also works.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.520
Next, we have another hexadecimal value.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.440
This is the hexadecimal for yellow.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.260
So, this doesn't work.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.480
Finally we have this
shorthand hexadecimal value.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.000
This one works too.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.800
The value here translates to 0000ff.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.215
Which is the standard value for blue.

00:01:03.215 --> 00:01:07.970
CSS actually support shorthand for
a number of different properties.

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:09.310
