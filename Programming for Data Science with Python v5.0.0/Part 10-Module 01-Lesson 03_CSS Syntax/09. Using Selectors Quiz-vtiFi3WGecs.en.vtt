00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.040
Starting from the top, the first
element has the attribute class.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.830
And it is set to the value, right.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.360
This matches up with our c.s.s.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.360
So that works.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.230
The second element also
has the attribute class.

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.340
But it is being set to
the value leftright.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.060
Although right is part of the entire
value leftright, this won't work.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.110
If we wanted to match on this element,
then we would need to change

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:30.860
the selector in our CSS to the entire
word leftright instead of just right.

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.790
Our third element has the attribute id
and it is being set to the value right.

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.740
This also doesn't work.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.160
The reason why is because our CSS
statement is looking to match

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.630
on the class right.

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:43.640
Not the id right.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.280
Finally, the fourth element
has the attribute class, and

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.520
it is set to three different values.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.510
Highlight, module, and right.

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.810
While this seems like it wouldn't work,
it actually does.

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.720
That's because you can set
multiple classes to an element,

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.110
as long as they are separated by spaces.

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.580
Also, the order of
the classes doesn't matter.
