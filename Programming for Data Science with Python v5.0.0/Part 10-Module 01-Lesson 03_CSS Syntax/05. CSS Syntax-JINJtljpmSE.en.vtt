00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.150
To change the color of, Hello, World!,
I need to write another CSS Rule Set.

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:08.370
In my file,
I will add a new line and type h1,

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.630
followed by some braces,
then the color green.

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:19.215
This will tell my browser to select
all of the h1 tags in my document and

00:00:19.215 --> 00:00:22.035
change the color of their text to green.

00:00:22.035 --> 00:00:25.635
If I save and refresh,
boom, there you go.

00:00:25.635 --> 00:00:26.695
Hello, World!, is now green.
