00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.550
So this is what my solution looks like.

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:05.705
I put each of the three elements on

00:00:05.705 --> 00:00:09.875
its own line because I think it's easier to read like this.

00:00:09.875 --> 00:00:11.740
Either way is actually valid,

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.610
one line or three lines but I like this way a little bit more.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.300
Notice that I have opening tags and closing tags

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.500
with content in between for each of my three elements.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.230
Also notice that my closing tags look different because they

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.945
all have a slash here after the less than sign.

00:00:29.945 --> 00:00:32.135
So, let's see how this looks.

00:00:32.135 --> 00:00:34.480
I've saved my file and I will come over to

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.460
the browser and I will hit refresh. And there you go.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.125
Notice that the p tag that says,

00:00:40.125 --> 00:00:43.790
" I'm Cameron," is all on its own line.

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:45.140
There is nothing next to it.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.900
But the two spans that say,

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.925
"I like teaching and web dev" are all on the same line.

00:00:50.925 --> 00:00:52.554
Remember this is a paragraph,

00:00:52.554 --> 00:00:58.635
so it wants to be by itself but spans are part of a line so they are part of a line.

00:00:58.635 --> 00:01:00.601
That's why I left this space right here.

00:01:00.601 --> 00:01:02.950
So, that goes to show you a couple of things.

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.280
One is that it's really not too bad writing these things

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.650
and two every type of element will display differently.

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.090
You'll be learning all about

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.000
the different elements and the way that they display later on.
