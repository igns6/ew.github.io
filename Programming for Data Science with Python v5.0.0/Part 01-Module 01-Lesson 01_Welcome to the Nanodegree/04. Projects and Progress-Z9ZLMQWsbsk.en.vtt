00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.920
By the time you graduate from your nanodegree program,

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:06.250
you'll have mastered relevant skills and learn to work independently.

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:09.195
We want to help you get there as efficiently as possible.

00:00:09.195 --> 00:00:11.530
That's why we focus on learning by doing.

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.260
To graduate, you complete a series of milestones,

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.565
most of which will take the form of projects.

00:00:16.565 --> 00:00:19.130
You can prepare for these projects by taking our courses,

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.505
although reviewing all of the course material isn't a graduation requirement.

00:00:22.505 --> 00:00:24.889
If you've come in with a ton of prior experience,

00:00:24.889 --> 00:00:27.120
feel free to try jumping right into the projects.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.360
However, most students go through the course material thoroughly,

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.235
to make sure they have the skills and knowledge they need

00:00:32.235 --> 00:00:34.680
to be successful in their projects and beyond.
